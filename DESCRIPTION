Version: 0.1.0
Author: Alvaro Sanchez-Villalba
Maintainer: Alvaro Sanchez-Villalbar <sanchezvillalba.alvaro@gmail.com>
Description: It allows the generation of protein sequences by retrieving the 
    data from the Protter API. The main updates is that it color-codes the 
    peptides of the sequence based on the intensity. It includes a shinyApp for 
    the easy generation of the images. For now it takes as input the 
    evidence.txt table from MaxQuant.
